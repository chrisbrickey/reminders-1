##### Excerpt from Joseph Furlott tutorial

It is key here to note that when doing development work you will run npm start which will spin up a webpack development server. You will visit your site by going to localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/#/ in your browser. The server has to be running for you app to work this way.

For deployment, you will use npm run build which simply generates your assets in /build. To view your app this way (as to simulate deployment), you will have to edit the newly created index.html.
